# The Odin Project

This project contains (as of today, 27.11.2022) the monorepo for the Odin Project.

No serious thought was given so far as to a structure, so it is likely that the repository will end up cluttered with examples used during the Foundations session, given to the number of short experiements created to explore the basic aspects of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

No guarantee is given. In fact, it is not expected that anyone will actually even open this project, but in any case the repository contents follow the MIT license, so you are free to copy, explore and reuse them at will.

If you are reading this, chances are  you're either checking my profile, or looking for resources on your own journey with The Odin Project.

In both cases, you are **highly encouraged** to get in touch either here, or via any other channel (links will be on my profile).
