        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>This is a subtitle</h2>
        <p>In our <strong>first paragraph</strong>, we will talk about nothing at all, and just freely write whatever comes to mind, I probably should have word wrap enabled, since now I can no longer see the beginning of my text, but that's something for the "me from the future" to tackle, it is not my problem in my current form.</p>
        <h3>Let's put a <em>different</em> header to act as separator</h3>
        <p>Perhaps I should have installed a lorem ipsum generator, but as far as I can see there's an Emmet Abbreviation which helps that, let me try it in the next paragraph.</p>
