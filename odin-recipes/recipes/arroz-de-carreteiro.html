            <li>2 cups rice</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>
            <li>100 g desalted and shredded beef jerky</li>
            <li>250 g pepperoni sausage appetizer</li>
            <li>70 g diced bacon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parsley (fresh)</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lemon (optional)</li>
       </ul>
        <h2>How to prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a kettle with a little more than 4 cups (tea) of water to low heat. Peel and slice half an onion into thin half moons. Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Cut the sausage into 3 pieces diagonally.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Brown the bacon and pepperoni sausage for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and saut√© for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until translucent. Add the garlic and mix for just 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Add the dried meat, rice and bay leaves. Stir well for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Before you start sticking to the bottom of the pan, measure 4 cups (tea) of boiling water and water the rice. Mix well, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon and partially cover the pan.</li>
            <li>Let it cook until the rice absorbs all the water, for about 20 minutes - to check if the water has dried, pierce the rice with a fork to see the bottom of the pan; if it's still wet, let it cook some more.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and keep the pan covered for 5 minutes so that the rice finishes cooking in its own steam. Meanwhile, wash, dry and finely chop the parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve next with chopped parsley and freshly ground black pepper to taste. It goes great with lemon drops.</li>
        </ol>
